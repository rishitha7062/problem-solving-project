5.1 Problem Statement:-
In the Byteland country a string "S" is said to super ascii string if and only if count of each character in the string is equal to its ascii value.
In the Byteland country ascii code of 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2 ...'z' is 26.
Your task is to find out whether the given string is a super ascii string or not.

Input:-
First line contains number of test cases T, followed by T lines, each containing a string "S”.

Output:-
For each test case print "Yes" if the String "S" is super ascii, else print "No"

Constraints:-
•	1<=T<=100
•	1<=|S|<=400, S will contains only lower case alphabets

Concepts Used To Solve:-
•	Arrays: An array is a collection of data items, all of the same type, accessed using a common name. A one-dimensional array is like a list; A two dimensional array is like a table. All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
•	While loop: A while loop in C programming is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

SYNTAX:
while(Condition)
{
	Statement(s);
}
•	For loop: : A for loop in C programming is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be excuted repeatedly a specific number of times.
SYNTAX:
for(init;Condition;increment/decrement)
{
	Statement(s);
}
•	if-else statement: If condition evaluates to true, the then-statement runs. If condition is false,the else-statement runs.
SYNTAX:
if (condition)
           {
           		then-statement(s);
           }
           else
          {
           		else-statement(s);
           }

•	ASCII: ASCII is the acronym for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a code for representing 128 English characters as numbers,with each letter assigned a number from 0 to 127.
